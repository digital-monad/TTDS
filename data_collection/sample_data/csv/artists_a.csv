1,ABBA,Mamma Mia,ABBA,,,"I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye-bye"", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go17Embed"
2,ABBA,Dancing Queen,Arrival,1976,1976-08-15,"You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Digging the dancing queen43Embed"
3,ABBA,The Winner Takes It All,Super Trouper,1980,1980-07-21,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)15Embed"
4,ABBA,Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight),Voulez-Vous,1979,1979-10-02,"Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day21Embed"

But I won't feel blue

'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow

6,ABBA,Fernando,Greatest Hits,1976,1976-04-12,"
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando10Embed"
7,ABBA,One of Us,The Visitors ,1981,1981-12-07,"They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that's breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that's breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call...3Embed"
8,ABBA,Waterloo,Waterloo ,1974,1974-03-12,"My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you

9,ABBA,Lay All Your Love on Me,Super Trouper,,,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me9Embed"
10,ABBA,Chiquitita,Voulez-Vous,1979,1979-01-16,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You'll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)

Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before

12,ABBA,Don't Shut Me Down,Voyage,2021,2021-09-02,"A while ago, I heard the sound of children's laughter
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark
I realise I'm cold, the rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know

I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left, I felt I'd had enough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I have learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all
I got to say I'm glad
Once these rooms were witness to our love
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad
To not so bad in my transformation (So now)

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down (Don't shut me down)
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down

13,ABBA,Slipping Through My Fingers,The Visitors ,,,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers


Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile7Embed"

To Las Vegas or Monaco

16,ABBA,When I Kissed the Teacher,Arrival,1976,1976-10-11,"Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher

17,ABBA,Happy New Year,Super Trouper,,,"No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I3Embed"
18,ABBA,Thank You for the Music,ABBA: The Album,1983,1983-11-06,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?

Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I

You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

I've watched you look away
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

En mi hombro, aqui llorando
Cuenta conmigo ya, para asi seguir andando

27,ABBA,Our Last Summer,Super Trouper,1980,1980-11-03,"The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Elysees
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play


And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer...2Embed"

We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done


It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and doneEmbed"

32,ABBA,The Day Before You Came,The Visitors ,1982,1982-10-18,"I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

I see it now
Through all these years, that faith lives on somehow
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow

And it survived
And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

We've only just arrived

Humble and grateful
To have survived

It all comes down to love

I keep thinking

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Keep thinking about his angeleyes

Keep thinking, had to pay the price

Certain that I'm out of sight, I pull over and turn off the car
And I bang the wheel
I can't believe that I've actually held it together this far
Seeing how I feel
But I said goodbye
And I did not cry
Though my heart ached

Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan (Keep an eye on Dan)

Make an effort not to upset him

So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

So is the outside world as you imagined?
Was it worth it severing the ties?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes

So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be

And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shakin'
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it and you say, ""Screw you""
I say I love you and I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could've been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now
You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it, but you're close to tears
Oh God, I'm sorry for the wasted years

(Not the one I could've been)

Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world

Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""

Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Little moments of happiness and of bliss
Does it ever get better than this?

Christmas stockings full of nice little things

And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces

Y no siento hoy verguenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

49,ABBA,That's Me,Arrival,1976,1976-10-11,"Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me, mhm
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me


There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching, but until then
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me1Embed"
50,ABBA,On and On and On,Super Trouper,1980,1980-11-03,"I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone""

A voyager, and a settler, they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried""

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on


The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on

52,ABBA,Bumblebee,Voyage,2021,2021-11-05,"He likes the lilacs in my garden
I love to watch him fly
He's just a tiny, fuzzy ball
And I wonder how he can fly at all
A world without him
I dread to think what that would be
And I imagine my distress
It would be a new kind of loneliness

But for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling carefree as I listen
To the hum of bumblebees

It's quite absurd, this summer morning
To think we could be trapped
Inside a world where all is changing
Too fast for bumblebees to adapt
From thyme to bluebell
From hyacinth to lily rose
Oh, how I do adore the sight
Of his rather clumsy, erratic flight
And for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling carefree as I listen
To the hum of bumblebees
Yes, for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling sad for those who'd never
Hear the hum of bumblebees

Oh yes, for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling sad for those who'd never
Hear the hum of bumblebeesEmbed"

I had to pick this fight 'cause I'd go mad without it
Bending like a willow when a storm is brewing
Oh yeah, that's you, but hey, I take the rap
This one's my mishap and there's no doubt about it

He tells me that he won't take the bait
That I have a tendency to exaggerate
And maybe he's right, but that is beside the point
Well, then why do I let it upset me?
Yes, and why am I biting my nails?

I made a mess this time and there's no doubt about it
Hands down, the fault is mine, and I'm prepared to shout it
Out across the rooftops if it makes you happy
Oh yes, I could, so hey, I take the blame
This one's got my name and there's no doubt about it

He says with forbearance in his eyes
Most couples we know are able to compromise
He's too good for me, that's one thing I know for sure
If that's true, why do I let it upset me?
There I go, stomping my feet like a child
But he is a good man, he tries to understand why I freak out
He worries and I know it's an honest reaction

I messed it up, alright, and there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight, I'd have gone mad without it
Hissing like a wild cat when I should be purring
But you know me, this isn't where it ends
I could make amends and there's no doubt about it
(This isn't where it ends) No doubt about it
(This isn't where it ends) No doubt about it

Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please


And I dream I'm an eagle

From the west and the north and from the east

And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand

So they let him play
Play their minds away

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep

Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool

You know it's only a lie
Ah-ha (ah-ha, ah-aa) The songs you sing are too romantic
Ah-ha (ah-ha) And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on, the usual way, he's such a clever guy
Then I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?
Strange how dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder, should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is...)

Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room1Embed"

Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight?

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing

Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

Won't somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance but drawing near?
Is it only a storm approaching?
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night
In the grip of this cold December

85,ABBA,I Let the Music Speak,The Visitors ,1981,1981-11-30,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak1Embed"

Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight you're all alone?
Oh, what a shame, you really want that girl
She doesn't care, still, you just dream of her

91,ABBA,Crazy World,Thank You for the Music,1976,1976-11-01,"I was up with the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cause I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
Then I realised
It's a crazy world

Baby, how could you do it?
You just told me lies
And you meet behind my back with other guys
Baby, how could you tell me
There was only me?
I was stupid to believe you, I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
""There is something,"" you said, ""that you may not know
There's a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long, long time
But he's back and I think he's going to stay
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way""

And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl

It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl

Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?

Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's going to be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow

94,ABBA,Man in the Middle,ABBA,1975,1975-04-21,"Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...Embed"

Somewhere in the middle of the never-ending noise

And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a lot
Come, make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil of cars
And the people, the air that you're breathing is me
Yes, I am the city, you let me be
People feed me with their lives, I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind, if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk, the language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars

?Por que siempre gana la gran atencion una simple cancion
Si he hace con el corazon?

Por eso quiero dar las gracias, a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias
Por lo que me hacen sentir, debo admitir
Que con la musica vale vivir
Por eso quiero dar las gracias, por este don en mi
Que suerte tuve, soy tan dichosa al cantar
Quiero que todos disfrutemos juntos
!Que feliz, que placer exclamar!

Quiero dar las gracias, a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias

Dying for my friend to hold me

107,ABBA,Lovelight,Voulez-Vous,1979,1979-01-16,"I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

And I feel so good, and I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight

You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I don't want to lose your lovelight
Shining like a star in the nightEmbed"

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no one can harm me

No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens, I won't let no one near

Until you tell me
Ginny, Ginny on my mind, won't you please
You really love me
Ginny, Ginny oh so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you
Ginny, Ginny on my mind

See me sitting in the palm tree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Ginny, Ginny on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow
I see a light in her window
Dark trees, soft breeze
Carry my message to her, please

See me sitting in the palm tree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud

I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do

So won't you tell me
Ginny, Ginny on my mind, won't you please
You really love me
Ginny, Ginny oh so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town

On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
Midnight Special

Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding-dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well, you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me

Shine its ever-loving light on me, on me, on me

Part 1

Part 2

When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears and I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake

Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh, I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

""Det racker dar.""
""Ja.""

Free as a Bumble Bee

I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here just waiting for next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be

As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour

What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
Rubber Ball Man

The poster on the wall of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all, you're a legend
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

Make the bandstand to a dreamland, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man

Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans, how we love you, rubber ball man
Crying Over You

I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

I'm waiting for you baby, I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you, it chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me, but now I know it's true
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

Crying over you
I'm crying over you
Crying over little memories of things we used to do
Oh Lord, I'm blue, I'm crying over you

He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

Giving a Little Bit More

There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too
I've been waiting, but my loneliness I get

When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby, you know I will
I could never stay on my own

Giving it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always giving a little more

And then I heard them laugh and say
""Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway?""

So I said, ""Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may""

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?

And all of those fellas at the local newsstand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them, then there's only a thing I can say

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?

What about Livingstone? (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
What about all those men (Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)

And you say to me, ""How I love you, girl""
When I hold you
Baby can't you see? It's a real dream world

You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white

Sigue creciendo
Se me esta escapando ya lo se

Y, sin querer, dejo el tiempo transcurrir
Cuando se va siento en mi la melancolia
Cierta culpa que no se fingir
?Por donde estan aquellas aventuras?
?Y los lugares que ibamos a ver? (Se me esta escapando al crecer)
Algunas pocas cosas disfrutamos
Hay tanto por hacer

De surgir otra vez y ver la realidad

""Ett, tva... ett, tva, tre...""

Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glittering in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle, my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
From afar
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star
Another Morning Without You

Raindrops on a windowpane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you
An Angel Walked Through My Room

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Mmm...
Echoes of a voice I knew
An Angel Passing Through My Room

Half awake and half in dreams (Half awake and half in dreams)
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room
An Angel's Passing Through My Room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room
Like an Angel Passing Through My Room

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
This boy cries

I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me, but I'm looking through your lies
It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries
This boy cries

I never thought I could cry for you
But honey, I will miss you till the day I die
Till the day I die

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face

What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la manana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento

Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razon
?Quien sabe las respuestas, quien puede elegir?
Si existen diferencias
Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir

Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la manana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento

Y todas las gaviotas que vuelan sin cesar
Lo veo y lo siento, y no lo se explicar
Esplendido momento
Sentir llover, y el sol nacer
Vivir y disfrutar

My life had been a river following
A safe, predestinated course
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well
How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
And once again
The river's flowing slowly
Following its safe and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

Yo te tuve y te perdi
Pero no lo comprendi
Me equivoque, pero jamas podre saber como ha sido
?Cuanto hara que no me ves?
?Es un ano? ?Es un mes?
Si llorando estoy, comprende que yo sufra en silencio
Necesito tu perdon

Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I pleaseEmbed"

Und ich merkte einfach nichts davon
Hab' ich mich denn so geirrt?
Was zu tun war hab ich getan

""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""

He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

Like a Humpty-Dumpty 'fraid of falling off your wall
I say if you ever wanna know what's going on
Gotta keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone

But now it isn't true
Now, everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
And then I found out that I was stuck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was fucked
I still don't know what you have done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear
And don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
And don't go shaving your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and now they're pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
Now everything is new
Everything is new
And everything is you
And everything is you
And all I've learned is overturned
What can I do?
And don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
And don't go shaving your devotion
Lay all your love on me
And don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

154,ABBA,Two for the Price of One (Demo),,,,"I am a young man with a simple occupation
I clean the toilets at a local railway station
There's no romance in my life
Sometimes I wish I had a knife
I read the offers on the advertisement pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they have nothing to say
At least not until today
When something special I read
This is what it said:

""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one""

I called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Lexie""
The voice was husky and it sounded kinda sexy
I was amazed at my luck
The purest streak of gold I'd struck
I said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat?
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what you said""
This is what I read:
""If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
It's a bargain if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one""

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

And I feel so good, and I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight

You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there

Droning on the usual way he's such a clever guy
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
He's dressed in the striped pajamas that I bought trousers too short
Gives me all his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does and me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies a fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All I see is the big balloon halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie so should I laugh or cry
Strange how dangerously indifferent I have grown cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies a fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All I see is the big balloon halfway up to the moon

Las bromas que se me salen seguro al reves
Pero hay un talento en mi singular
Y es que la gente me escucha al cantar
Y me hace feliz
Orgullosa lo puedo anunciar

Por eso quiero dar las gracias a las canciones
Que transmiten emociones
Quiero dar las gracias
Por lo que me hacen sentir
Debo admitir que con la musica vale vivir
Por eso quiero dar las gracias por este don en mi

Todos decian que fui una nina precoz
Baile y cante, sobresali por mi voz
Y hoy me pregunto: ""?Cual es la razon?""
""?Por que siempre gana la gran atencion?""
Una simple cancion
Si se hace con el corazon
Por eso quiero dar las gracias a las canciones

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made

And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love49Embed"

Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind

But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me

Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to

I let my heart decide the way

Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me

Will choose the poison over me?

I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired

You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me, boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you8Embed"

And so I got soaked in the wild wild west

That's when I, I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow-catching in the wilderness

Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?""
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you17Embed"

It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours, too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest, you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I'm findin' myself with you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me, the one for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah9Embed"

Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired

I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away

When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done

Where free cunt strips and young blood drips
And kids falls through the holes of hollow gun tips and
You wanna harm me, don't try to call me
You ain't gon' bore me
Your slipping from my palm trees
Aw baby, baby please re-l-a-x
Together we about as fly as LAX
And, I don't wanna hafta call you my ex
Well babe, I don't wanna hafta call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How'm I ever be a man again she wants to be a model
My sunshine and light got stole away
Once the golden state took my gold away
Cali
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

You scold as you walk past him
No more truth laying we only talk sarcasm
Strutting, out there, need to be a model
Now you can catch me giving hickies to beer bottles
Get it? cause I'm kissing the neck, giving her heck
For whether not you give 'em respect
I know if you go, you just might blow
But if you leave, you can catch more than a cold
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don't make the cut, but that's how your wrist feel
Conscript script slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world you'll find allies on the axis
You'll find actresses in alleys on their backs
With directors giving oral in return for a practice

Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
Trees, trees please don't leave
The trees will be changed, when it rains will they shelter you?
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I thought that you was real
I guess I couldn't tell the truth
Trees go knee deep in the dirt
They reach for the sky but they're still down to earth
But you, you just leave like leaves in the autumn
Didn't think you would get on, get gone and just out them
Doubt them and reroute them not count them
I never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can't de-weed ya
I can't walk away, away from this tree uh
And, as bad as I wanna see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack
Cali

Oh

I really thought the pain would pass
Its been nearly an hour since I thought of you
Cause you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least by that I know, that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away
(Chorus)
And now youre gone, there's nothing else I want
And now that its over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame

Im tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A couple more till I forget your name
I saw a boy that looked like you
I didn't quite know what to do
I took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasn't there
(Chorus)
And now youre gone, there's nothing else I want
And now that its over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame

Adele: I look away, I look away
Daniel: And if your minds made up
Adele: I look away, I will look away

There is no simple life for me

222,Adele,Hello (Rap Cover),Return Of The Dec,2016,2016-08-26,"Verse 1:
What would you do?
If you was me, I was you?
Would you move on? Go and find someone new
I know it hurts, believe that I'm hurting too
I guess I can't hide it as well as you cos
Look
I woke up next to the baddest bitch I've ever seen
And even then, all I could think about was you and me
My friend's tell me ""Dec, brother just let it be""
But unless they been through it, they don't know what the fuck I mean
So please
Girl
Tell me what do I do?
I know that nobody's perfect
But I'm perfect for you
And girl your perfect for me
That's something you couldn't see
I tried to show you but what's the point if you don't believe it?
Now tell me why did you leave?
Did you not love me no more?
See I can hide all the pain
But what remains is the scars
I was the best I could be
I know that I had my flaws
But I gave you all that I had
Spent more then I could afford!
Hook

Verse 2:
I spent $5,000 on a ring to call you my Mrs
Then you had the nerve to say I gave you no commitment?
There was no way that I could save you
3 years is what I gave you
Then you go an leave me and find a new man 3 weeks later
My sister thinks you cheated and honestly I don't blame her
Cos moving on that quick was way too strange of a behaviour
But I bet that he's happy cos he see's your posting pictures
But bruv I bet my life she thinks about me when she's with you
He don't love you like I love you, He don't need you how I need you, he don't see you how I see you, he don't breathe you how I breathe you
And you know it
So tell me what the fuck you see in him?
We both know that you still love me
So you shouldn't be with him
You should be with me
Right here in my home
Right here all alone
Makin' love until the morn'
You love how I turn you on
The one thing that I love and hate the most
Is the people always change but the memories don't
And lately I can't even eat, lately I been feeling ill
When you cannot sleep at night
That's when you know shit is real
You don't even need a bullet, you don't even need a pill
If you ever wanna die fall in love and you'll get killed

223,Adele,Now and Then,,2008,2008-04-21,"Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

But, how will you ever know if you never try?
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, the more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm strong or falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that we'll almost fall apart
Then burn the pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But, without each other, nothing else is enough

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you

Everyone, this is Greg Kurstin. Give it up for Greg Kurstin. Thank you very much for this award. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to my record labels XL and Sony, thank you to my manager, Jonathan. I always get so nervous... And I'd like to thank Greg, because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me. And I was really hard work this record, had a very short attention span, and he would come to me in England so that I didn't have to leave my son, and yet you would leave your son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I've ever done. So thank you, Greg

...Thank you to my mom and dad...Embed"

228,Adele,Rolling in the Deep (Remake),No Holds Barred,,,"For claiming heart and soul you're pretty heartless
You were scared to hurt me, yet you did it all regardless
Neither one of us ever meant to start this
Now there's space between us and there's sorrow in the margins
Why'd our first date feel just like an interview?
You asked me everything, I held it in and I refused
To tell you anything, I thought that you should earn the truth
And get to know me, but you never had intended to
Now I see that you're devious. I'm hating it
I was a brief relief to previous relationships
Now I'm over-analyzing your text messages
Last things you said just aren't adding up or making sense
I'm positive I felt just like a risk to you
You were unaware of all the things that I could give to you
Now you're back with her to simulate a happy home
When I'm dead and gone, I can say I lived the truth

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feelin'
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep (yeah)
You had my heart inside of your hands
And you played it to the beat

What was up the night you hit me on my cell?
(do you wanna see me cause' I'm heading there right now)
I've got some things to do can we meet up when I finish?
You said (I'm on my way so you got twenty minutes)
I dropped everything that I was doing then
Like a fool, and we put your favorite movie in
I didn't ask what was going through your head
And of course you didn't tell me cause' you never wanna clue me in
And after everything you said I didn't consider
That you would go and get right back with her
So either you lied bout everything that she did
Or you're just an idiot, I really don't know which
I never kiss and tell, but you already did
I'm guessing in your story you're the one who's innocent
The night we met you couldn't keep off me
So when you're lying bout it be sure to speak softly

We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep (yeah)
You had my heart inside of your hands
And you played it to the beat

You're gonna wish you (uh)
Never had met me (uh)
(we could of had it alllll x2)
Tears are gonna fall (yes)
It all (we could of had it)

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feelin'

You had my heart inside of your hands

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side

And thinking you would listen too, oh

It was dark, and I was over
Until you hold my hands and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees, were far too weak
To stand, in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew, all the things you'd say
They were never true, never true and the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I, touched your face
Well it burn while I cried 'cause I heard it
Screaming out your name, your name
When I sit, with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever, you and me
Together nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew, all the things you'd say
They were never true, never true and the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I, touched your face
Well it burn while I cried 'cause I heard it
Screaming out your name, your name
I set fire, to the rain
And I threw us, into the flames
When I felt something died 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time
Sometimes I'd wake up by the door
That heart you hurt must be waiting for ya
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for ya
I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I, touched your face
Well it burn while I cried 'cause I heard it
Screaming out your name, your name

Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

The one that shoots me each and every time
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
Time and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you)
Even in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Even though I do know how you play

You went back to what you know
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

I love you much, it's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt

And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say, ""When we married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good

Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president

They think forever I'm rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know or am I a fool to ask?
I'm well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar

All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown

You should be stronger than me
You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my ladyboy

He said, ""The respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said, ""You don't know what love is, get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless
Second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold, I stand before him (Before him)
It's all I can do to assure him (Assure him)

And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life

You don't like ballers

But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life

I refuse to let him go (To let him go)
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

We put it in writin'
But who you writin' for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, recitin'

Like you're readin' my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale (Bitter finale)
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, woah, woah

Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singin'
It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowin' down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothin' new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise, mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, it's you again
Listen, this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed
I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now, it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everythin' is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothin' new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing when we lay

I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh

It's not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh, my mistake, you're not a floozy, then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduce me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady's interest I just met
The love scholar, she's the teacher's pet
Every other eve', we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings, just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker

It's affectin' my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns of bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG
There's fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, ""No, you're so deep""
I said, ""No, let's go through it""
Historically so ruthless, Feds came for Joe Louis
She said, ""My man, you need to laugh sometimes""
Classifies me as a bore, I told her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it, hussy
See, a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it's a dragon, it's a bastard you're in tune with, just lust
I'm through with you after I crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet some Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK, I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, ""Yeah""
You know how me and Amy are, straight players
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care about what you got, I want it all

My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, ""What is it 'bout men?

And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing

I feel like writing you a letter
But that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mister-false-pretence, you don't make sense

Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there
And I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect?
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed your touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I don't know how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience's thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying, and you don't care

279,Amy Winehouse,Stronger Than Me,AMY (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2003,2003-10-06,"You should be stronger than me
You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy
He said, ""The respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said, ""You don't know what love is, get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me3Embed"
280,Amy Winehouse,You Know I'm No Good,More Fish,2006,2006-12-12,"Meet you downstairs, in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull T-shirt
You say, why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks, 'n'
You need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson
I know, we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cause how I get down
Not cause you was out there, messing around
I would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back
Try g'ing me, like I don't know how to mack
I'm a don - top of the line, I stay flying
Stop trying, to keep covering the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all
Let's go, before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block, when we in the hood

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, nasty girl, try to play me

Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a web we weave
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
Hear that lame? You love how I bring the pain?
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

You had to be nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, girl
You can't leave the kid... can't leave the kid
Don't worry, I'mma be around forever, nasty girl
Don't forget, I'mma be around forever, nasty

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips, as I soak my feet

Yo, get the bath and body works, pumkin and spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams
Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it
I could forgive the past, but I never forget it

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Got to forgive the past, but I never forget it
Nasty girl... nasty girl... try to play me
Nasty girl, you had to be a nasty and try to play me
Nasty girl... try to play me, try to play me
Nasty girl, got to forgive the past, but I never forget it2Embed"

Have to lay awake guilty once you sleep
Or would you take me in your arms and weep?
I'm culpable for your scornful ways
And I can still taste better days
Now maybe it is for the best

How can I tell her I love her

But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

From Ipanema, from Ipanema

And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right, anticipation at its height
Lived and waited in hotel rooms late at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
With every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I let myself get so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to cut myself off, I had no capacity

He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)

I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things than him at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
And this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon

I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams

Do me good and all this craziness will disappear

He's so broad from behind, he's beautifully defined
I missed him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing
Or feel his shifting weight
So I'm confused and quizzical
Bunny wants you now
I just wanna get physical
Let me tell you how

Dear past, present, and future, the rappin' Fela Kuti
Pockets fat like ya booty, I love it when it's juicy
So meet me at Sweet Chick, the private booth
You got that mac-n-cheese, I swear you're lovin' the truth
Sundays were made for me and you
Farmer's market, play the pool
Curl up on the couch, watch a documentary or two
Smoke curl around my mouth, exhale then put it out
Don't wanna go out, I need a girl up in this house
Oops... correction
I need a woman that know peace of mind's a real bag
A true love I never had
So what the hell am I lookin' for?
Someone who's not bossy and not insecure
Your smile could cure cancer, your frown could start a world war
Somebody to join me while I'm sitting at the shore, sure
Yo, I got money on my mind but I still can't find my love, yeah
I got money on my mind but I still can't find my love

Sexy in her clothes, can't wait to get them off
Lames slide in your DMs, we laughin' at them boys
Comfortable in the Benz, you comfortable while I make ends
Not the jealous type, you comfortable in ya own skin
Funny now, they wanna hear from me, weird
Been away six years, the kid is still hungry
Runnin' through these courses of life, divorced the ex-wife
Made more money, I'm doin' more than alright
Alright, try to figure why am I the guy they can't get rid of
I saw friends come to an abrupt end, I'm outspoken

Yeah, hella money on my mind but I still can't find my love
No love, Amy

When I catch myself, I do a 180
I stay up, clean the house
Least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
And that silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears when the sun sets

He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart, I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
And he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light
He is fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed

309,Amy Winehouse,For Amy,,,,"Frustratingly it's not a call you can ever make it must be received. It is impossible to intervene.
I've known Amy Winehouse for years. When I first met her around Camden she was just some twit in a pink satin jacket shuffling round bars with mutual friends, most of whom were in cool indie bands or peripheral Camden figures Withnail-ing their way through life on impotent charisma.
Carl Barat told me that Winehouse (which I usually called her and got a kick out of cos it's kind of funny to call a girl by her surname) was a jazz singer, which struck me as a bizarrely anomalous in that crowd. To me with my limited musical knowledge this information placed Amy beyond an invisible boundary of relevance: ""Jazz singer? She must be some kind of eccentric,"" I thought. I chatted to her anyway though, she was after all, a girl, and she was sweet and peculiar but most of all vulnerable.
I was myself at that time barely out of rehab and was thirstily seeking less complicated women so I barely reflected on the now glaringly obvious fact that Winehouse and I shared an affliction, the disease of addiction. All addicts, regardless of the substance or their social status share a consistent and obvious symptom; they're not quite present when you talk to them. They communicate to you through a barely discernible but unignorable veil. Whether a homeless smack head troubling you for 50p for a cup of tea or a coked-up, pinstriped exec foaming off about his speedboat, there is a toxic aura that prevents connection. They have about them the air of elsewhere, that they're looking through you to somewhere else they'd rather be. And of course they are. The priority of any addict is to anaesthetise the pain of living to ease the passage of the day with some purchased relief.
From time to time I'd bump into Amy she had good banter so we could chat a bit and have a laugh, she was a character but that world was riddled with half-cut, doped-up chancers, I was one of them, even in early recovery I was kept afloat only by clinging to the bodies of strangers so Winehouse, but for her gentle quirks didn't especially register.
Then she became massively famous and I was pleased to see her acknowledged but mostly baffled because I'd not experienced her work. This not being the 1950s, I wondered how a jazz singer had achieved such cultural prominence. I wasn't curious enough to do anything so extreme as listen to her music or go to one of her gigs, I was becoming famous myself at the time and that was an all consuming experience. It was only by chance that I attended a Paul Weller gig at the Roundhouse that I ever saw her live.
I arrived late and as I made my way to the audience through the plastic smiles and plastic cups I heard the rolling, wondrous resonance of a female vocal. Entering the space I saw Amy on stage with Weller and his band; and then the awe. The awe that envelops when witnessing a genius. From her oddly dainty presence that voice, a voice that seemed not to come from her but from somewhere beyond even Billie and Ella, from the font of all greatness. A voice that was filled with such power and pain that it was at once entirely human yet laced with the divine. My ears, my mouth, my heart and mind all instantly opened. Winehouse. Winehouse? Winehouse! That twerp, all eyeliner and lager dithering up Chalk Farm Road under a back-combed barnet, the lips that I'd only seen clenching a fishwife fag and dribbling curses now a portal for this holy sound.
So now I knew. She wasn't just some hapless wannabe, yet another pissed-up nit who was never gonna make it, nor was she even a ten-a-penny-chanteuse enjoying her fifteen minutes. She was a fucking genius.
Shallow fool that I am, I now regarded her in a different light, the light that blazed down from heaven when she sang. That lit her up now and a new phase in our friendship began. She came on a few of my TV and radio shows, I still saw her about but now attended to her with a little more interest. Publicly though, Amy increasingly became defined by her addiction. Our media though is more interested in tragedy than talent, so the ink began to defect from praising her gift to chronicling her downfall. The destructive personal relationships, the blood-soaked ballet slippers, the aborted shows, that YouTube madness with the baby mice. In the public perception this ephemeral tittle-tattle replaced her timeless talent. This and her manner in our occasional meetings brought home to me the severity of her condition.
Addiction is a serious disease; it will end with jail, mental institutions or death. I was 27 years old when through the friendship and help of Chip Somers of the treatment centre Focus 12 I found recovery. Through Focus I was introduced to support fellowships for alcoholics and drug addicts that are very easy to find and open to anybody with a desire to stop drinking and without which I would not be alive.
Now Amy Winehouse is dead, like many others whose unnecessary deaths have been retrospectively romanticised, at 27 years old. Whether this tragedy was preventable or not is now irrelevant. It is not preventable today. We have lost a beautiful and talented woman to this disease. Not all addicts have Amy's incredible talent. Or Kurt's or Jimi's or Janis's. Some people just get the affliction. All we can do is adapt the way we view this condition, not as a crime or a romantic affectation but as a disease that will kill.
We need to review the way society treats addicts, not as criminals but as sick people in need of care. We need to look at the way our government funds rehabilitation. It is cheaper to rehabilitate an addict than to send them to prison, so criminalisation doesn't even make economic sense. Not all of us know someone with the incredible talent that Amy had but we all know drunks and junkies and they all need help and the help is out there. All they have to do is pick up the phone and make the call. Or not. Either way, there will be a phone call.Embed"

She's sitting pretty with some other guy
Now I find you saw the best in me
When I was blind
Now I see, you are the best for me
The best for me
Friday and I think I'm fine
Singing for my valentine
Honey child of mine
You say I'm waiting for fall
While I'm just unconditional
Saying you can have it all
So how am I here again?
Always out with other men
Now you're just my friend
Let me look out for ya then
'Cause I'm not waiting
For you to say you will
Now I find you saw the best in me
When I was blind
Now I see, you are the best for me
The best for me
You saw the best for me
And I never realized
But I was blind, I was blind
I was blind, I was blind
You saw the best for me
But I never realized
'Cause I was blind
Now I find you saw the best in me
When I was blind
Now I see, you are the best for me
The best for me
Now I find you saw the best in me
When I was blind
Now I see, you are the best for me
The best for me

Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we married""
'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Yo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a web we weave
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
Hear that lame? You love how I bring the pain?
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no goodEmbed"

To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans

Never lasts me long

Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh
And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no, no
I observe, yeah, I don't chase
But now I sit with consequences thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be
And although my pride is not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me

His message was brutal, but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride, yeah, is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb

You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I'd have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say
Man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Frank's in there and I don't care
(Put it in the box, put it in the box)
Just take it, take the box
Take the box

I came home this evening
And nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter
But that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mister-false-pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me at Christmas

You are everything
He means nothing to me

Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there
And I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect?
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you

Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you
So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find

Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowin' down
River of no return

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now, it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everythin' is slowing down

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say, ""When we married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no goodEmbed"

Get over this
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Da-da-da-da

First time that I saw your eyes, from afar
Beauty like the sunrise or the stars was like raw
I wanted you, fell in love with you, needed you
Wanted to be with you, sleep with you, live a life with you
But I was nervous, I was uncertain
Life for me had never been working
Too much hurtin'
But we hooked up, Fell in love
But was it love? Was it real love?
We made love
Orgasms that I've put you on
Spasms that I've put you on
Tantrums that I've put you on
Thought our love was strong
But it ain't all about sex
We keep getting vexed
Shit is getting complex
We keep getting stressed
Girl, what is up with you?
There ain't no peace in you
Tryna keep it sweet with you
Reaching my peak with you
What, you're leaving who?
Not me that's not true
What, you're leaving who?
You're not leaving me
I can't see you now (I can't see you now)
So let's just put each other down
I'm so sick of this shit
So get over it
Just get over it

You're exactly the same
And we went through all the bad habits again
It's like nothing has changed
'Cause when we kiss, it's not right
Something's strange
We've been here so many times before
So understand why I can't see your face no more
The chemistry we had is dead
You might as well be fucking me in my head

You bang a next guy, I'll bang a next girl
But you're still my world, cherry
You are still my girl, you're my only girl
But it seems you ain't havin' it
Girl ,you're full of shit
Throwing fits like you're on a acid trip
I wanna quit you, but I can't
I love you
Girl, I need you
Said our love was true
What is up with you?
Another night
Yeah, another fight
Our last maybe
Why do you keep yelling all the time?
Fine, it's over
And it was 'til the other evening
Had our secret meeting
Creasing up the sheets in
Are we through? Are we really through?
Am I fucking you? Are we back together?
With just me and you?
What is going on?
This is long, this is wrong
Is our time standing still or is it time to move on
Let me know 'cause I don't know
What I blow blow
You won't let me know
No, no, wanna know
If your body's a no go
Can't be having this, end up having kids
Started with a kiss, life of bliss
Wish it wasn't like this, but I guess it is, so that's it
I quit, can't be taking much more of this shit
So I guess it's goodbye and so-long
So long
Girl, gotta move on
Move along
Gotta be strong and hold on
But it's hard
I can't see you now
Let's just put each other down (Let's just put each other down)
I'm so sick of this shit (I'm sick of your shit)
Get over it (Get over it)
Get over it (Get over it)
I can't see you now ('Cause I can't see you now)
Let's just put each other down
I'm so sick of this shit
Get over it
Get over it
I can't see you now
Let's just put each other down
I'm so sick of this shit
Get over it
Get over itEmbed"

And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly

Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you
Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you

You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black
We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to....
I go back to us
I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her

Tears dry on their own
I am grown
Tears dry on their own
I am grown
Tears dry on their own

All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I am grown
Tears dry on their own
I am grown
Tears dry on their own
I am grown
Tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry (My tears dry on their own)Embed"

Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sang her ""Lullaby of Birdland"" every night
I sang a lullaby every night
Sang for my Ava every night

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

With dread, I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until, one day, she couldn't be heard
She spoke until, one day, she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet soundEmbed"

Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
Got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that all aboard
 
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track that moves me back
I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey homeEmbed"

Thought you had so many lessons to learn""

Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""

I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

Pretend it's part and plan of my elaborate game
When, in time, you come around
Ignore my youth
I'll have gotten over you
To tell the truth

I keep telling myself
That yours ain't a special pace
Your trails aren't familiar
We just work in the same place
The preferential treatment that I gave before
Exactly the kind of shit I can't do no more

Save myself the headaches
Pretend to forget
'Cause, if I can't remember
I cannot regret
If I shut my mind down
I can't reminisce
Until it's gone, the memory of the man I missed
However strange it is for you
It's harder for me
To work with and around you so impersonally
And the longer I ignore it
The less I'll be concealing
I won't want you anymore
Or have to hide my feelingEmbed"

And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
So don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed
You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped

Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now, it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand

'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
""Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?""

When will we get the time to be just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends?

And, no, I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
So we need to find the time to just do this shit together
'Fore, before  it gets worse
Hey, I wanna touch you, I wanna touch you
But that just, that just hurts

When will we get the time to be just, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?

And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown

Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505

In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

It seems like once again you've had to greet me with ""Goodbye""

Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

That you just swallowed have got you going

Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, ""Long Hot Summer""
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war

There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans

Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no

I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul
You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth

That the emperor were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles

In the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain
On anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it, just in case

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away your laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen

He's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane
There might be tellies in the back of the seats in front, but Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

And it feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

Yesterday, I saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us, it seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat, and half wonder if you won it at all
And don't say owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery

Tread softly, stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless

The liar takes a lot less time

I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes, that will get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
The varnish off that newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter

Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me

About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance

Linking arms, sinking hearts

Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires

In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul

Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

Smoking, drinking, drag riding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction
But then I switched it off, changed my ways
Run the area like, ""Oh, my days""
But a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just one
But it's hard to fight the temptation, son
The panic will fall down around you

And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger, flicks you on your socks

I go high-pitched
He'll talk and make your voice sound high-pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone
His heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw
It's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph
Is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying bye

And you will queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let him join the club
He knows how to put a cork in the fuss
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they missed

The old pantomime villain follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs
And he spies through the slats

One, two, three, four!

One, two, three, four!

Well, I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute, you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your jerrycan of words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say
Apparently

Oh, he said, settle for the draw
Well, you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?
Well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is, I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And let's not fall in the trap of answering back
I am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
That's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire
Don't get out your jerrycan of words and... tones


And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say

Coming to claim what is his to claim
Ten percent faster with a sturdier frame
He's certainly come into his own
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be, my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion, it must be good
Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud
Forgot to kick the tin
He knows where she's going, but don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in
They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him

As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said ""You're mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

[Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called

Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called

Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

Oh you were reading a book about some idiot and telling me about another
I was so severely underwhelmed I thought I might never recover
Straighten the rudder girl and sail me up stairs
And go and find somebody who cares
Well we might not be the perfect partners but tonight we make a pair

They come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment
They haunt the boulevards and bars
They pray to wishing wells and stars
They ride the hurricane of hope
Not looking back, but on they go
Toward the distance and deceiving
And all the while they keep believing
They are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers
And when they pair off two by two
They feel they are the chosen few
And though their beds are made of straw
They feel like velvet in the night
And so the night is never ending
Its made of distance and pretending
Coz they're special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers
And when love goes away
And when love goes...
Goodbye...
Catches in their throats like cotton
Rises in their hearts like rain
The good times suddenly are all forgotten
The hunt begins again
They search the subways and the streets
Their faces tired, like their feet
Their bodies aching to be warm
And so they hide behind the moon
Their loneliness inside them growing
But they take comfort in just knowing
That they are special and apart
The lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers
And when love comes again
And when love comes
Hello...
Rises from their throats like singing
Catches in their hearts like wind
The good things
Strangers in their arms are bringing
Makes life all right again
They turn their faces to the light
No longer hiding in the night
So unashamed and unafraid
That they can face each others faults
And though the waltz will have its ending
There is no harm in just pretending
That they are special and apart

Afterwards those spiky whispers said he brought his own rope
And skipped the bits they loathed
Didn't scramble to find a dock leaf and capture back our hope

498,Arctic Monkeys,Arctic Monkeys - How We Wrote 'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor',,2011,2011-11-11,"I did find like the lyrics for it like not long ago like scribbled on like a piece of paper, it was quite funny
Like find like the -
(Was there any different changes?)
Oh yea, like loads, yeah they were all sort of stuff about like cigarettes and stuff, I don't know but erm
(Not any you regretted not putting in there now?)
No no no, they were all, there were some stinkers in there
Arguably there still is but erm
(Laughing)
They, erm, it was... can't remember, I can remember recording it like the first time we did it
Well cause we did it with this guy Alan Smyth in Sheffield, that we did like a lot, like all his first sort of recordings with
And there was this version of it, and then when we started like, we started this first record with
Like when we were beginning to sort of proper make the record,
We started with James Ford and this guy Mike Crossey, in Liverpool
And we had like a week and we'd been on tour and we play- we recorded like ten songs in a week or somet
And we were like ""this is it! we've gon- done his album""
Y'know
""Fucking put it out tomorrow please, yesterday if you can""
And erm
But everything was kinda recorded at like, did it on tape and played everything at like 300 miles an hour
And it were like, it kinda, bit too like live or something I don't know
And at that point, it was suggested to us that perhaps we'd like try a different avenue so then we went back with this producer called Jim Abbiss
And went to a studio in Lincoln
And er, and sorta, y'know sorta, recording...
But y'know going through the songs and like listening to the demos
And sorta tryna, you know, pick the best bits about and whatever
Cause everyone were kinda really into these demos of it
So we sorta wanted to get a bit of that but kinda like a better recording of it
It was weird cause when we were... recording that tune
The video was already like on telly for it
Like cause w- people'd be like watching TV in't other room like ""ahh quick we're on we're on MTV or whatever""
Cause like the v- the version we did for the video
Like we just made another recording like it's just us playing like a TV studio or whatever and-
(It was a live thing wasn't it? The video was telling a live performance)
Yeah that version of it was just like there and then
So it's weird like we were tryna cut this single in one room
And it was like on telly in like the other room like us
""Erm, yeah, just use that""
But erm, but no we did it with, er, did it again, yeah did it there with Jamie like in, in Lincoln
And then that became the... version
But it all came from that like drum thing on the beginning, you know like the, I mean originally, that was like the
What was like the first part of that song, was like that kinda drum thing
(Can you remember sorta coming up with the guitar bit and all that stuff? was that you? was that cookie or?)
I play like the lead on it yeah, and like this sorta cord thing, not really, I can't really, can't remember, what, when that happened or what even like, what practice room we were in at that time really but
I remember Matt playing that thing round, cause I think I guess it was like some exercise or something he'd like seen somewhere or like a version of it which he'd like sped up or somet and he were like doing it as fast as he could and then
Like a lot of them songs, like then, used to come from something like that he'd play
(Really?)
He almosts like plays, like riffs on drums sometimes or whatever, or plays like leads or somet so
(What does it mean to you now that song? at this moment in time)
It's like more fun than ever to play it now
Like I think I probably fell out with it for a, for a moment like somewhere along the way
But I kinda
Yeah I fell out with eve-
I fall out with all of them at some point, but that's definitely one that like
I'd never imagine like not playing it
And now when it kinda comes round in sets, it's just like, fun y'know
Like that's it
It's erm
Yeah no we all sorta really enjoy playing that
And it's one of them you can like
Cause some of the other songs we've written since then I guess are a bit more like complex and you have to kinda concentrate a little bit more
And like think about singing in tune and like playing the right notes
And that one...
(Yeah)
You can sorta, just like have a laugh with... few minutes
(Oh cool)
Still manage to murder it sometimes though, it kinda feels like a lot of them older tunes
We don't play a lot of them because it feels like you can't anymore, like whatever it took to sorta write and like play them songs when we used to, 'int' there anymore
And for some reason, some of them have a longer shelf life than other ones
Or it sorta sometimes feel like we're doing like covers of-
It feels like they're cover songs that we play like
(Really?)
But we kinda can't do a cover of Fake Tales of San Francisco but I think we do a pl- a pretty good I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor cover.Embed"

And he twists my guts
As the only thing that's repelling as his invitations
Are his excuses
And he said ""I am the conductor
Put me in a terror pocket""
He did a stint
Master in a craft
He'd squint through his spectacle
He'd drop a dirty hint if he thinks that he could impress you with the unacceptable
And he has turned through all the pages with his fingers
And covered them with goo
And he wants to put the bite marks on you
He wants to put them on you and it hurts my back
Because the only thing that's as heavy as the adoration
Is the days of hanging out on his lawn
And he spilled without a sounding alarm
And he frightened me to death

Or sat on a tatty settee
At a mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet is surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well, maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with the mind on clever lines
Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking, love, where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight

To give me the invite
Don't worry, it's alright

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen meEmbed"

Illuminations on a rainy day

Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

I left my message but did he fuck get back to me?
And now I'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenadeEmbed"

Agree that there in't no romance around there

You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, 'cause their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Ooh (Hehehe, hehe)

Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world

Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are

You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling

I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries

Understand we are his back
And when he puts the arc in your back
Understand that we took him to Heaven
Where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes
You show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that
""Girl, I'll be your knight, your knight in shining armor
'Cause you're my heart, Queen""
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours

You're the one who taught me how to twist and shout because you shout non-stop and you're so twisted too!

Once I used to fidget 'cause I just sat home

But now I'm just like Gidget and I gotta get to Rome!

But now that I'm a woman, I like bigger men
And I don't need a Barbie doll to show me how

'Cause Mama, I'm a big girl now!

And now I just wanna give it a try
Mama, I've been in the nest for far too long
So please give a push and mama watch me fly...

Watch me fly!

Hey mama! Say mama!

Someday I will meet a man you won't condemn-

And we will have some kids and you can torture them-

But let me be a star before I take that vow

Be my fire in the cold

Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

See, what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing

Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older

Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now

But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me, suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

Are you a mouse or a bear or a..? Um
Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
You're the cutest unicorn in the world
That's fine, we can just go to riff on it
Sorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry
I was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry
Alright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over

They come, they come to build a wall between us

Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change

Do she love me, do she love me not?

Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away

You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you

A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
They slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face

Never looked inside myself, though on the outside, I looked good!
Then we met and you made me the man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you, no matter what you weigh, 'cause
Without love, life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love, life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lyin'
Never set me free, Tracy, no, no, no

Once I was a simple girl, then stardom came to me
But I was still a nothing, though a thousand fans may disagree

Tracy!

Fame was just a prison, signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue 'til you came banging on my door
Now without love, life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love, life is making out withto Perry Como
Darling, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, throw away the key, I'm yours forever
Throw away the key, yeah, yeah, yeah

Living in the ghetto, black is everywhere ya go
Who'd've thought I'd love a girl with skin as white as winter's snow?

In my ivory tower, life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back

'Cause without love

Life is like a beat that you can't follow

Without love

Life is Doris Day at the Apollo

Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be
Without love

So darling, never set me free

I'm yours forever, never set me free, no, no, no

If you're locked up in this prison, Trace, I don't know what I'll do

Link, I've got to break out, so that I can get my hands on you

And girl, if I can't touch you now, I'm gonna lose control

Seaweed, you're my black white knight, I've found my blue-eyed soul

Sweet freedom is our goal

Trace, I wanna kiss ya!
Then I can't wait for parole!

'Cause without love

Life is like a prom that won't invite us

'Cause without love

It's like getting my big break and laryngitis

'Cause without love

Life's a '45' when you can't buy it without love

'Cause without love

Life is like my mother on a diet!

Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked, 'Do Not Enter'
Darling, I'll be yours forever, 'cause I never wanna be without love

Yes, now you've captured me

Without love

I surrender happily

Without love

Oh Seaweed, never set me free, no, no, no

You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why

Hercules

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

When he smiled, the girls went wild with (""oohs"" and ""aahs"")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every ""vahse""
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the glad in gladiator?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-

Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one

He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero

You go day into day into day...

I turned thirteen, my parents got divorced. And I moved from New York City to the middle of nowhere

Day into day into day

I turned thirteen, and I kissed a boy. More than once!

I turned thirteen and signed a virginity pledge

Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day...

I was diagnosed with an eating disorder
I failed math. But we won the championship!

And I'm a little bit braver, a little bit broader
A little bit brighter, a little bit...

I turned thirteen and I had to have spinal cord surgery. God, that sucked

Day turns to day turns to day

I got busted for driving my Dad's pickup

Day turns to day turns to day!

I got drunk!

And I've been lookin' in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime

My parents split up

But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet

There are too many answers that I didn't get

I need a little less pressure

And a little more time
I am trying to follow
I am trying to lead
I am trying to learn what is true
I am trying to be what you want and I need

We all have a little more homework
We all have a little more homework

Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

Go and hide, run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right

Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm still hurting1Embed"

All those nights together, our special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow

Let's go past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from all the mistakes we made 'cause
It's so clear, every year we get stronger (stronger!)
So don't give up, and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone
We got so far to go!

Haven't you shown us enough?

Oh, my God, how times have changed!
This girl's either blind or completely deranged
Oh, the time seemed to halt
When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs

It's always been my dream to dance on this show!

Aww, maybe you ought to go back to sleep

Childhood dreams for me were cracked
When that damn Shirley Temple stole my friggin' act!
But the crown's in the vault
From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs
Those poor runner-ups may still hold some grudges
They padded their cups, but I screwed the judges
Those broads thought they'd win
If a plate they would spin in their dance
Haha! Not a chance!
'Cause I hit the stage, batons ablaze!
While belting high Cs and preparing cheese souffles! Ahhh!
But that triple somersault
Was how I clinched Miss Baltimore Crabs!

Oh, almost dinner time! Shouldn't you be waddling along?

Amber! Haven't I taught you not to judge a book by its cover?

No...

Oh! This is America, where everyone deserves a separate, but equal chance to fail. I'll handle this
(sung)
Are you scared we're on live?

No, I'm sure I can cope

Well, this show isn't broadcast in-

CinemaScope!
I never drank one chocolate malt-
No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs

How many sweaters do you own?

Well, I'm sure, I've got plenty
Let me see, I have three, five
Wait, I have twenty!

I would say, ""Oy, gevalt!""
But I can't... I'm Miss Baltimore Crabs!

You're too wide from the back

Honey, look at her front!

Wait, are we on Candid Camera?
Okay, where's Allen Funt?
Do you dance like you dress?

Girls, there's no need to be cruel

Would you swim in an integrated pool?
*Councilmembers gasp*

I sure would! I'm all for integration. It's the new frontier!

Not in Baltimore, it isn't

Can I audition for Corny now?

Mmm... I'm his producer, and may I be frank?
First impressions can be tough and when I saw you, I knew it
If your size weren't enough, your last answer just blew it!
And so, my dear, so loud and stout
You'll never be in-

So we're kicking you out!

With your form and your face, well it isn't your fault
You're just down with a case of Miss Baltimore Crabs!
(spoken)
You may go

Uh, thank you?

I could tell, they really liked you!

Hello ma'am, I want to audition

And I wanna be 18 again...
How about you bow and exalt?

Zooming up behind me

689,Ariana Grande,A Hand For Mrs. Claus,Christmas: A Season of Love,2019,2019-10-18,"Every December, we always remember
To celebrate the fella in the suit
We see the promos for reindeer and his glow nose
Believe me, I think Rudolph's nose is cute
Now I'm a fan of Frosty, I go ga-ga for The Grinch
But beneath the hype, are they the type you'd turn to in a pinch?
There's someone more deserving of applause
How 'bout a hand for Mrs. Claus
Mm

I'm not complaining, I'm sure it's very draining
Pulling off a Christmas Eve world tour
My point in this is it's his marvelous missus
Who gets it done the other three-six-four
Who's really checkin' all those lists
And fillin' all them shelves
She's a master multitasker who works faster than the elves
Who keeps the North Pole hot 'til winter thaws
The answer's clear, it's Mrs. Claus, mm

She reads every Christmas letter
Fills out a Christmas sweater
Better than old Santa any day
She runs the operation
With no appreciation
Send a little Christmas love her way
Oh, oh yeah
She just gets no respect
She works so hard

Now I'll sing a fa-la-la
And I'll shout a ho-ho-ho
But I'm bouncin' out this ballad for the gal who runs the show
Join me in this very worthy cause
How 'bout a hand for (Oh, oh, yeah)
Let's make it grand for (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y
And so I'm offering this simple phra-ay-ay-ase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found
You gotta stick around

Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me
I've always been the kind to think things out
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about
So I
I make my mind up, I make my mind up
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so
Wait a minute

Till I got you all figured out
You gotta stick around, stick around, around
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
Take a look, take a breath
Take a chance on everything I've said
Take your heart. And take your time
And maybe one day you'll be mine
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. (Woah)
Yeah!
You gotta stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
Stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized

713,Ariana Grande,This Is Not A Feminist Song,,2016,2016-03-12,"The world, it needs an anthem
For all of womankind
The song to fight, the song to right
The wrongs of all of time
So we put pen to paper
And wrote all through the night
A gorgeous ode to feminism
Well within our sights

But this is pretty nuanced stuff
And putting it all in one song was tough
And that's why...

This is not a feminist song
We tried real hard but it took too long
This is not a feminist song
Cause we were scared we would do it wrong
We know women need an anthem
A song to call their own
But we didn't write that anthem
We went home

Every woman has a struggle
And every struggle's real
But just try and write a song
That captures every woman's deal
So instead of writing lyrics
Here's us running in the sand
And here's a bunch of lens flares
And an old woman's hands
Not to call a woman old
Or judge a woman's hands
We know a woman shouldn't be
Reduced to just her hands

We stepped right into that trap
It's so hard to navigate this crap
And that's why...

This is not a feminist song
So technically, it can't be wrong
This is not a feminist song
I feel like we've been singing so long
Our ancestors, they fought for us
So they deserve a song
But this is not that song, so move along

Now here's some powerful footage
For a song, we did not write
It's Malala, Maya Angelou
And Madeleine Albright
And RBG, she taught me that women can be strong
And that women have the right to choose
To bail on this whole song, oh, yeah

And that's why
This is not a feminist song
We're just women singing a song
But doesn't that make it a feminist song?
I guess this was feminist all along

This is a feminist song
Tweet it, #FEMINISTSONG (hashtag ""feminist song"")
(Where are the men in this feminist song?)
An excellent point, now move along
Cause now it's time for you at home
To weigh in on this song
And tell us if we handled it all wrong

This tough and tricky landmine of a song
Ah, yeahEmbed"
714,Ariana Grande,Suitcase,,2010,2010-01-09,"Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same
Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes
Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)
Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore
Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away

Get out of this place and

Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair

There's life in the streets
Hot people at brunch
And I've got a hunch
Mimosas are gonna be bottomless
Oh, oh, oh, turning off Zoom
After fifteen long months stuck on mute

No lockdowns anymore
We can finally walk out the door
The sunlight is a fantasy
It still doesn't feel real to me
No lockdowns anymore
Will they still take my temp at the door?
Shout out to our favorite M.D
Anthony Fauci

Oh, oh, oh, look at my hair
I'm no longer scared to have it cut
Oh, oh, oh, back in the gym where I start to sweat
Um, maybe not yet
Say, ""Hi"" on the street
Air kiss on the cheek
It's been so long since I've put on my shoes
So, oh, oh, let's hit the club
Or get drunk and get matching tattoos
No lockdowns anymore
Time to go back to work indoors
No more sweatpants or Zooming in
While I really watch Bridgerton
No lockdowns anymore
Traffic is so much worse than before
The world's such a new place to me
What's an NFT? I have no idea. What?

So, oh, oh, been a long wait
I'm so ready for life to re-start
(No lockdowns, no lockdowns)
(Ready for life to re-start)
No lockdowns anymore
Gonna live the next year outdoors
We could see a movie at three
Making plans is like sex to me
It's what we've been waiting for
To embrace all that life has in store
It's time to make new memories

I wonder if he's looking at it too

I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (It's never enough, babe)
So close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enoughEmbed"

If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know... we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Ah, pushing me away so I give her space
Ah, dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do... you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know... we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you.. instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Slow...
Take it slow...
Take it slow...

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come downEmbed"

""The incredible double standard that we  face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, it's shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I don't think a male artist would be in this position right now. Sorry. If i'm speaking about something that I'm passionate about, I'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what I believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about.""
""Is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between? ... Is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between? ... You need a little brushing up on equality over here.""
""I have a long list of things I'd like to change ... I think, judgement in general. Intolerance, meanness, double standards, misogyny, racism, sexism. You know, all that shit. There's lots we've got to get started on. That's what we need to focus on. We've got work to do.""
- responding to the question ""If you could use makeup or your phone one last time, what would you pick?"" on California's Power 106 FM
""I'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy, I'm not Big Sean's ex, I'm not Niall's new possible girl. I'm Ariana Grande.""
- to The Sun
""What I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I ... do not. Belong. To Anyone. But myself. And neither do you ... I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating/ married/ attached to, having sex with (or not)/ seen with ... but by their value as an individual. ""
"" are so ignorant sometimes. Stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies. It's okay to be different ... to be curvy or to be thin. When did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies? We were having fun! Dancing on stage. 'What's she shaking tho???' I'm shaking my pretty, cute, petite ass next to Nicki's pretty big booty. Both are f---ing awesome. How about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are? That  be nice. So tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down.""
- on Instagram
""Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled 'After Black Power, Women's Liberation' and 46 years later ... we're still not quite there yet! If a woman has lots of sex (or any sex for that matter) ... she's a 'slut.' If a man has sex ... HE'S. A. STUD. A BOSSSSSS. A KING. If a woman even talks about sex openly ... she is shamed! But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used 'bitches'/'hoes' ... how lovely) he's had ... he is regaled. If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!! If a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated/celebrated.""

The title of Ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since she's had such a tumultuous year (ahem, remember the donut incident?), but she insists this is about all of us.
""You judge because you don't focus on me, you don't focus on each other,"" she explained. ""You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, you'll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you don't, this is who we are. What are we making fun of? What's there to make fun of? We should apologize for that.""Embed"

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be

Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be

Just for now, just for now, just for now

How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot

You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away

You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper

Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Painted a picture
I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment
Tangled up in your sheets

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We're laughing over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
So, don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go
You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You'll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I'm guessing I wasn't your type, hey

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don't understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause

Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate, but I don't know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river (Want you to cry me)
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody

759,Ariana Grande,Open Letter to Fans,,2014,2014-07-14,"I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book...... she wouldn't judge anybody by their appearance.... she believed the best in people.... she wasn't afraid of anything or anybody.... she never let people's judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted... she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)
One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that's the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way
So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some 'dumb' kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us
Hopefully we'll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I'd make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They'd live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)
Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn't have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can't imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted
Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started... you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We've been through so much and you are still here... and we've got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever12Embed"

Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

I know what you like

If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go, I got you

Chodz tu i zobacz jak fajnie nawijam, chwila!
Moze bys sie fajnie przylaczyl?
Nie ma tego zlego, co by nie wyszlo na dobre - taki progress, ze chyla mi czola i... tu
Nie ma tego zlego, co by nie wyszlo na dobre; Miuosh i Onar? Csss....
Dla mnie nie ma tych, ktorych nie slucham
Sa ze mna Ci, ktorych nie slychac
Nie zjadaja mnie nerwy, to ja zjadam nerwy; pycha
Wyciagam kafla za kaflem, dla mnie ten biznes to Yenga
Nie wydaje mi sie, zebys tak nawinal kiedykolwiek, chlopcze! Choc sie nie oszczedzam
Bez umiaru, lece nad wyraz jak potega
Parys, Pepe w Realu, SB Maffija, wbijam, zeby ich deptac po pietach
Powietrze jest lekkie
Sumienie jest ciezkie
Myslenie jest grzeszne
Pocieszmy sie bez nich
Probuje szczescie
Czuje jak tester
Jestem powszechna i smiertelna

I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
Plyne pod prad i tak lapie dystans
Wymyslam flow i stad pryskam
Oni chca mnie skonczyc (nie ma szans)
Ze zdumienia przecieraja oczy
Bo kazdy z nich wie, wie, wie, wie, wie, wie
Ze lece tu jak chce
Nie powstrzyma mnie nie, nie, nie, nie, nie
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Przeskakuje na wyzszy level
Jestem coraz dalej od ciebie
Juz dwa razy drozszy refren
Lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?Embed"

768,Ariana Grande,"Billboard Cover: Ariana Grande on Fame, Freddy Krueger and Her Freaky Past",Billboard Cover Stories,2014,2014-08-15,"Ariana Grande is easily mistaken for an old-school good girl. The singer wears Audrey Hepburn-style strapless gowns, travels everywhere with her mother and trades lovey-dovey messages with on-again, off-again boyfriend Jai Brooks (of Internet comedy boy-troupe The Janoskians) over Instagram. Last year, she implored fans to boycott SeaWorld after the damning documentary Blackfish came out.
""I think people see me as a little cutesy thing,"" she says, looking, in fact, demure and adorable, seated with her feet tucked underneath her on a giant leather couch. ""But I'm literally the most sardonic person you've ever met.""
Proud oddball Iggy Azalea -- Grande's collaborator on ""Problem,"" the song-of-the-summer contender that has elevated Grande to superstar status -- allows that Grande, while ""very sweet,"" is definitely ""quirky."" Last year, bloggers simply had her pegged as a ""mini-Mariah"" for the lush, unabashedly '90s R&B sound of her debut Yours Truly, which went to No. 1.
On Aug. 25, Grande presents her follow-up, My Everything, and three huge singles released in the run-up to the album have already redefined her as a state-of-the-art pop diva: Besides ""Problem,"" a super-catchy, not-at-all-smooth, kiss-off track, there's the Ibiza-ready ""Break Free"" and the woman-power anthem, ""Bang Bang,"" with Nicki Minaj and Jessie J.
Grande, who now lives in Los Angeles, says she was ""a very weird little girl"" growing up in Boca Raton, Fla.: ""Dark and deranged. I always wanted to have skeleton face paint on or be wearing a Freddy Krueger mask, and I would carry a hockey stick around. I was like a mini-Helena Bonham Carter.""
Sitting in the cavelike lounge we've retreated to in downtown L.A., she looses a throaty, almost maniacal laugh. ""For my fifth birthday party we had a Jaws theme and all my friends left crying. I mean, I still am that way. But when I was little it was more concerning. There was a stage, when I was 3 or 4, where my mom thought I might grow up to be a serial killer.""
Instead, Grande embarked on a show-tunes-inspired career. She started acting in community theater a few years after the creepy birthday party, and by freshman year in high school, she auditioned and scored her first casting in a Broadway show, 13. That led to a supporting role on Nickelodeon's teen musical sitcom Victorious and a starring part in the Victorious spinoff, Sam & Cat.
Republic Records chairman/CEO Monte Lipman signed Grande when she was 17 and little-known beyond Nickelodeon, after a friend excitedly sent him YouTube videos of her covering Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Sam & Cat only lasted one season; the final episode aired in July, amid much drama. But two weeks later, ""Break Free"" placed No. 1 on iTunes.
Making a hit record was always the goal. ""I remember when I first came to L.A. to meet with my managers, I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' "" recalls Grande. ""They were like"" -- she drops her voice a few registers --"" 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'""
Grande's restless ambition is accompanied by a twitchy energy: She's hummingbird-tiny at just five feet tall, often walking with a stutter step thanks to her giant high heels.
She makes dramatic arm gestures as she talks, with the words tumbling out of her mouth. ""I am hypoglycemic so sometimes I'll get anxious if I forget to eat,"" says Grande. ""When I was a little girl, I would turn into the Tasmanian devil.""
""Because she is a perfectionist, the one thing I'll say to her every now and again is, 'Ari, perfect is not always about being perfect -- it's those flaws that people can relate to,'""says Lipman. ""I don't want you to get to the point where you're gritting your teeth and your fists are all balled up.""
Grande agrees. ""I'm a micromanaging workhorse,"" she says, nodding vigorously. ""Absolutely an obsessive-compulsive workaholic.""
Even as an 8-year-old kid playing Annie, she didn't want to stop working. ""I just wanted to do every single show,"" she remembers. ""However many there were in a year, I was in every one, whether I was a chorus girl or the lead or doing the lighting.""
At that time, Grande's older half brother Frankie claimed star status in the family. ""My brother was always the one in the spotlight and I liked that,"" she explains. (Frankie's a performer and producer currently working his outsized personality and dyed Mohawk on the deathless CBS reality show Big Brother.) ""It was like he was the entertainment for me.""
Grande's mother is Joan Grande, who runs a telephone and alarm system company and moved with Ariana's father from New York to Florida when she was pregnant with their daughter.
Grande's father, Edward Butera, owns a successful graphic design firm in Boca Raton. ""My brother and my mom and my grandparents were always there,"" she recalls. ""And my dad, until my parents split up when I was 8 or 9.""
The week I spoke with Grande was a rough one. Her beloved grandfather had just passed away at the age of 90, and she was posting photos of him -- as a dashing young man in a fedora; on his deathbed, Grande smiling by his side -- in online tributes. Like everything else, Grande shares her grief with her fans. In person, though, she struggles to articulate it.
""It's just so fresh and I'm still mourning,"" she says in a whisper. ""I don't even know what I would say to be able to encompass what an amazing man he was."" She wipes her forefinger delicately under each eye and smiles. ""I mean, how much time do you have?""
While in Florida caring for her grandfather, Grande met up with her dad, whom she hadn't seen in a while. ""It was good,"" she says. ""I love my dad."" But she's made no secret of the fact that her parents' divorce and relationship with her father have been tricky. ""Everybody with divorced parents knows what it's like to be in the middle. Even years later I'm still in the middle.""
Grande responded, in part, by cultivating interests from her grandparents.
""I have an obsession with all things vintage and classic and old-school, everything from Marlene Dietrich to Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons to Connie Francis,"" she says. ""My grandpa was always telling me I should sing songs from the Great American Songbook.""
But her most towering influence may be Madonna. After hearing Grande easily harmonize to Madonna albums all afternoon, I half joke that the two should do a song together.
""Oh my God, my heart would stop,"" she gushes. ""She is strength, she is freedom, she is wisdom beyond anybody's comprehension."" Grande was raised Catholic but ""departed from that and started practicing my own things when I was around 12 years old,"" she says. Now, like Madonna, Grande practices Kabbalah.
""As a fellow Kabbalist, I know how hard it is to exercise those tools in your everyday life,"" says Grande. ""Especially in a world where everything is so egocentric and all you do is talk about yourself and promote yourself.""
Of course, Grande has had to be a tireless self-promoter -- even after making it onto TV, she was posting homemade videos online. Her pleasures now are simple, even sparse: ""The most relaxing thing to me is going to the beach at night,"" she says. ""I mostly do it in Boca."" She'll rehearse with her dancers, even when there's no event coming up, for the company.
And sometimes she'll fly out her best friend Alexa Paige, a pal from Florida now in college, for fun. But she's closest with her mother, who she calls ""fierce,"" and her brother. They'll play Heads Up! when a few free minutes open up. Frankie being away on Big Brother ""is excruciating, because I have no communication with him, and he's missed so many things.""
The afternoon we spend together, Grande is surrounded by functionaries, but instead of a combination assistant-slash-best friend, it's Joan who makes sure to bring her two bottles of water -- one cold, one at room temperature.
Grande's also remarkably good at keeping her own counsel. ""When she sent me 'The Way' featuring Mac Miller,"" Lipman recalls, referring to Grande's first big single, ""she goes, 'I just made a record that is a smash.'"" When Lipman asked to start planning the video, she said it was already done. (It's a sweet, simple clip in which a radiant Grande chastely flirts with Miller.) ""
That video, which cost virtually nothing, is the only video we ever made for that song,"" says Lipman. ""It's got 100 million views, and at the end of the day, that was her.""
In scaling up her sound for My Everything, Grande needed to sacrifice control. ""Everything that I was terrified to try and was absolutely positive I would hate, I tried,"" she says, explaining that at first she was ""intimidated"" by ""Problem"" and wary of recording straight-up dance tracks.
""It's not like, because Ariana has a huge range, she can only do that kind of music,"" says her ""Break Free"" co-writer Anton Zaslavski, aka Zedd.
Grande wasn't so sure. ""I hated it at first,"" she says, describing her vocals on ""Break Free,"" which she sings ahead of the beat. Co-producer Max Martin convinced her to sing in what she calls a ""more forward placement.""
""I was like no, no, no! Please just let me sing it how I would sing it,"" she mock-whines. ""But he was like, 'Just try it. Trust me.'"" She loved the results. ""I was so pleased when I tried something that I thought -- no, that I knew I would hate.""
""Problem"" was also a difficult sell. ""I loved the idea of it, but the chorus, the whisper was so shocking to me,"" says Grande, referring to the unexpected, intimate refrain sung by Big Sean -- ""I got one less problem without you"" -- which co-writer Savan Kotecha first dreamed up in an airplane bathroom, and completed for Grande after he was brought in to work on My Everything.
(""I sang it into my phone,"" he remembers. ""I had that voice in my head for a year."")
In the main part, she wanted to show off more of her range -- her ""normal, I'm-not-screaming voice."" But ""what makes an Ariana song an Ariana song is that it's a song no one else can sing,"" says Kotecha. ""She's probably one of, if not the best, technical singers of her generation.""
""When I was 14, I wanted to make a straight-up, like, India Arie record,"" remembers Grande, laughing. ""Something really soulful."" Is it her inner Bonham Carter that pulls Grande toward what she calls ""the bittersweetness"" of soul music?
""Maybe,"" she says, sighing. ""I honestly think it could be a past-life thing. You know those things where you love something but you don't know why, or you're scared of something but you don't know why? I feel like all of those things are from another life.""
Obviously there's more to Grande than a shrill, tightly wound diva in training -- Election's Tracy Flick with a four-octave range. She displays a thoughtfulness and a weirdly sane-seeming mysticism that suggest true depth.
Balancing real life as a person and unreal life as a famous person is a big part of what Grande works on these days.
""I never thought it would be a thing for me to go out in my pajamas,"" she says.
Does she feel pressure to hide aspects of her private life? ""I do and sometimes I don't. I vacillate between saying, 'I need to keep some things private' and 'I should be able to be myself, and I need to share what I love and everything with the world!'""
Grande's also hard at work planning live shows to support the new album. ""I did a tiny tour, but it was very small and intimate and on not much of a stage,"" says Grande of the shows she played last year, opening up for Justin Bieber.
""It's new, very new. It's going to be a big shock for me. Here's the thing,"" she says, leaning forward and speaking in a conspiratorial whisper.
""I have to launch this album, and I get to do a tour, which all sounds fine and dandy...but I just love being in the studio. I could start a new album right now, tonight. That sounds the most enticing to me. I love it.""Embed"

770,Ariana Grande,Ariana Grande on Grief and Growing Up,,2019,2019-07-09,"""I was researching healing and PTSD and talking to therapists, and everyone was like, 'You need a routine, a schedule,' "" Grande says, yanking off a pair of black, ultra-high platform ankle boots so that she can crisscross her legs on the sofa and sit close. The boots, by the way, are Sergio Rossi, though we have to dig into the insole to determine this; Grande knows about music, she says, and not about clothes. ""Of course because I'm an extremist, I'm like, OK, I'll go on tour! But it's hard to sing songs that are about wounds that are so fresh. It's fun, it's pop music, and I'm not trying to make it sound like anything that it's not, but these songs to me really do represent some heavy shit.""
We are sitting in the home studio of Tommy Brown, Grande's close friend and a producer on Thank U, Next, at the end of a noiseless cul-de-sac in Northridge, in the San Fernando Valley. (The earthquake that occurred here in 1994, six months after Grande's birth, was among the strongest ever recorded in an American city.) A layer of cloud casts a dull light over the low-lying suburban houses and their front yards dotted with iceberg roses and pepper trees. Grande's fans, known as Arianators, rivaling the Beyhive and the Little Monsters as the most dedicated and attuned in music, know that she loves the dour weather, hates the beach of her cosseted Floridian youth. ""I'm like, please bring me the cold and the clammy and the clouds,"" she says. ""You want what you didn't grow up getting.""
Although she has a home of her own in Beverly Hills, the kind of vast, marble-paved manse that young stars buy before they're ready for them, Tommy's is where she likes spending time when she's in Los Angeles. Grande is wearing black leggings and an oversize sweatshirt emblazoned with the words SOCIAL HOUSE, the name of a pop duo from Pittsburgh who are friends and now one of her opening acts. A large white pearl, her birthstone, glimmers on her finger. (She is a Cancer: a little crab happiest in her shell.) It occurs to me that we're talking about the weather for precisely the reason that people talk about the weather, in order to dance around the ""heavy shit."" It's a dance that spins out quickly. Grande begins to cry nine minutes into our conversation, at the mention of Coachella, which she headlined this year for the first time. Following a bumbling interchange of apologies--""I'm so sorry I'm crying,"" ""I'm so sorry I made you cry""--she explains that the festival offered near-constant reminders of the rapper Mac Miller (born Malcolm McCormick), her dear friend, collaborator, and ex-boyfriend, who died of an accidental overdose in September 2018. I imagined we would visit this and other delicate topics somewhere deep in our discussion, but grief creates a conversational black hole, drawing all particles to it. ""I never thought I'd even go to Coachella,"" she explains. ""I was always a person who never went to festivals and never went out and had fun like that. But the first time I went was to see Malcolm perform, and it was such an incredible experience. I went the second year as well, and I associate...heavily...it was just kind of a mindfuck, processing how much has happened in such a brief period.""
For a woman who recently turned 26 and is enjoying the most successful chapter of her career, it has also been a spectacularly, and publicly, brutal couple of years. Fifteen months before Miller's death, in May 2017, Grande had just finished the encore of a sold-out show on her Dangerous Woman tour in Manchester, England, when a suicide bomber detonated in the foyer, leaving 23 people dead, including an eight-year-old concertgoer. Shell-shocked and reeling, Grande and her mother, who was in the audience that night, flew home to Florida. (The tweet she mustered the next day was for a time the most-liked in the medium's history: ""broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."") But she quickly determined that before she was going to sing anywhere again, she needed to sing in Manchester. She returned two weeks later to visit survivors in hospitals and families in mourning. And she staged a benefit concert that raised $25 million. Guest stars included Coldplay, Katy Perry, and Justin Bieber, and Grande cruised the stage belting out her dirtiest songs at the request of one victim's mother after it was suggested that the bomber, who had links to the Islamic State, had acted in protest of her racy pop persona.
But it was Grande's culminating rendition of ""Over the Rainbow,"" intoned through her sobs, that is the night's eternal image. If you didn't know Ari, as her friends call her, if you sorted into that other group and assumed that Grande was a lab-engineered Frankensinger, a sexy cyborg extruding melismas in baby doll dresses and kitten ears, here may have been the first piece of evidence to the contrary. ""Ariana's an open book,"" says her friend Miley Cyrus, who flew over for the concert. ""She has always shared her experiences with this beautiful blend of reality and the fantasy that pop culture requires. But holding her in my arms that night and feeling her shake from the loss of lives, literally feeling her heart pounding against mine--when you can let down the personas and cry with the rest of the world, it's unifying. It's a reminder that music can be our greatest healer.""
She released no original music until the following spring, when ""No Tears Left to Cry,"" the first single off her fourth studio album, Sweetener, offered up a dance-floor hymn to optimism in the face of catastrophe. (The album's closing track, ""Get Well Soon,"" addresses Manchester's survivors directly. Including a period of silence at the song's end, it clocks in at 5:22, the date of the bombing.) But in November 2018, after Miller's death and the dissolution of her brief engagement to the Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson, Grande had to acknowledge that she was far from cried out, and she did so in a now-famous tweet: ""remember when i was like hey i have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA bitch u thought.""
These words, classic darkly humorous and self-deprecating Grande, are about as far as she has been willing to go toward addressing the events of the last two years. ""I've been open in my art and open in my DMs and my conversations with my fans directly, and I want to be there for them, so I share things that I think they'll find comfort in knowing that I go through as well,"" she explains. ""But also there are a lot of things that I swallow on a daily basis that I don't want to share with them, because they're mine. But they know that. They can literally see it in my eyes. They know when I'm disconnected, when I'm happy, when I'm tired. It's this weird thing we have. We're like fucking E.T. and Elliott."" Grande admits to approaching our conversation with a mix of dread and guilt about her dread. ""I'm a person who's been through a lot and doesn't know what to say about any of it to myself, let alone the world. I see myself onstage as this perfectly polished, great-at-my-job entertainer, and then in situations like this I'm just this little basket-case puddle of figuring it out."" She laughs through her sniffles. ""I have to be the luckiest girl in the world, and the unluckiest, for sure. I'm walking this fine line between healing myself and not letting the things that I've gone through be picked at before I'm ready, and also celebrating the beautiful things that have happened in my life and not feeling scared that they'll be taken away from me because trauma tells me that they will be, you know what I mean?""
GRANDE GREW UP IN Boca Raton, Florida, in a gated community of expensive and lushly planted Mediterranean-style homes. Her mother, Joan Grande, Brooklyn-born and Barnard-educated, owns a business selling marine communications equipment; her father, Edward Butera, is a graphic designer. The couple divorced when Grande was eight. Ariana grew up in character, in a household that relished characters. The theme of her third birthday party was Jaws. She loved to run around the house in a Jason mask, and at Halloween, Joan liked to buy animal organs and leave them floating in dishes. ""My family is eccentric and weird and loud and Italian,"" Grande says. ""There was always this fascination with the macabre. My mom is goth. Her whole wardrobe is modeled after Cersei Lannister's. I'm not kidding. I'm like, 'Mom, why are you wearing epaulets? It's Thanksgiving.' ""
Grande declared herself early. Joan recalls a car ride when Ariana was around three and a half; NSYNC was playing, and over and over the little girl perfectly matched JC Chasez's high notes. There was a karaoke machine at home, and everyone--Ariana, her older half-brother, Frankie, and her mother--was always singing. ""The soundtrack was Whitney, Madonna, Mariah, Celine, Barbra,"" she recalls. ""All the divas. Gay, divas, divas, gay, belting divas."" Joan also played a lot of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and the family watched old musicals, especially the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney pictures. ""She was so intrigued by how pristine and precise these women were,"" Joan recalls. ""She studied them carefully."" When the family loved a show, they could be obsessive; Joan estimates that they saw Jersey Boys on Broadway close to 60 times.
Grande has a preternatural gift for impersonating other singers and actresses--a talent that has made her a surprise darling of the nighttime-television circuit. (After watching her host Saturday Night Live three years ago, Steven Spielberg texted Lorne Michaels to sing her praises.) Grande credits her healthy vocal technique to having learned to mimic Celine Dion, in particular, whose seamless blending through her registers and careful vocal placement have given her greater durability than many of her peers. ""I learned how to make it sound like I was belting and being loud without actually belting and being loud,"" Grande explains. ""The voice is expensive, and if you're spending it properly, you'll be able to keep spending it."" When I tell her that I'm surprised by her interest in Judy Garland--not an obvious source of inspiration for a pop artist born nearly 25 years after her death--she cradles her arms in a manner that immediately brings the legend to mind. ""I would stand in front of the TV and mimic her body movements. I was always fascinated. She carried herself in a way that was so protected and soft and Judy.""
After years of local children's theater, Grande landed a role in the Broadway musical 13. (She was 14 at the time.) Weeks after the musical closed, she was cast as the goofy sidekick Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon show Victorious, which made her a star with the tween set. ""I never really saw myself as an actress,"" she says, ""but when I started talking about wanting to make R&B music at 14, they were like, 'What the fuck would you sing about? This is never going to work. You should audition for some TV shows and build yourself a platform and get yourself out there, because you're funny and cute and you should do that until you're old enough to make the music you want to make.' So I did that. I booked that TV show, and then I was like, OK, now can I make music?"" While Victorious marched on, in her free time Grande liked to upload YouTube videos of herself singing covers of Adele, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey. It was a virtuoso rendition of Carey's ""Emotions,"" which Grande posted in August 2012, when she was 19, that made her a hot property. Since then she has worked at a frantic pace, turning out five albums in six years, all of them certified platinum, and touring the world three times.
If one aspect of Grande's career has been immune to critique, it's her singing. Patti LaBelle came to know her several years ago, when Grande asked the R&B icon to perform at her birthday party. They have become friends. ""She's surpassed her peers,"" LaBelle says. ""And she does everything herself, which is not always the way with the young baby girls. She doesn't need any machines. She's a baby who's able to sing like an older black woman."" LaBelle, whose four-year-old granddaughter, Gia, wears an Ariana ponytail, recalls the time when both singers performed for the Obamas at the Women of Soul concert at the White House. Grande was extremely nervous. ""I said, 'Girl, you're a beast. Go up there and sing like that white-black woman you are.' Ariana can sing me under the table--and listen, I can sing.""
Grande's personal style has left her more vulnerable. Some critics have chafed at her uniform of bubblegum lampshade dresses and thigh-high boots, with their uneasy mix of sybarite and schoolgirl--as if she were the contrivance of a horny industry Humbert. She is not. ""She's like an R-rated version of a Disney character, super-vivid,"" says Pharrell Williams, who produced much of Sweetener and clocked long hours in the studio with Grande pre- and post-Manchester. ""But she's full of self-awareness. That meta-cognition is part of her personality."" To those troubled by her image, Grande has a silencing reply: She just likes it. ""I like having my funny character that I play,"" she explains, ""that feels like this exaggerated version of myself. It protects me. But also I love disrupting it for the sake of my fans and making clear that I'm a person--because that's something I enjoy fighting for. I can't help disrupt it. I'm incredibly impulsive and passionate and emotional and just reckless. The music is very personal and very real, but yes, if you can be me for Halloween, if drag queens can dress up as me, then I'm a character. Go to your local drag bar, and you'll see it. That's, like, the best thing that's ever happened to me. It's better than winning a Grammy."" (Incidentally, Grande won her first Grammy this year, when Sweetener was awarded Best Pop Vocal Album.)
While the character has been remarkably consistent across her career, Grande feels it's only in the last year that she has been able to make the music she has always wanted to make. ""There was a two-album period where I was doing half the songs for me and half the songs to solidify my spot in pop music,"" she acknowledges. ""A lot of my singles have been hilariously lacking in substance. You're talking to someone who put 'Side to Side' out as a single. I love that song, but it's just a fun song about sex."" I ask her if it ever feels uncomfortable to gaze out at an audience of thousands of nine-year-old girls while singing a song about having so much coitus that it's hard to walk straight. ""They're for sure gonna have it. I promise. I promise that your kid's gonna have sex. So if she asks you what the song's about, talk about it."" One clever aspect of Thank U, Next is the way it coaxes out your most cynical notions about Grande, then forces you to reevaluate them. Consider the three singles that ruled February: ""Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored,"" ""7 Rings,"" and the title track. A song ostensibly about female rivalry is in fact about self-love; a paean to materialism celebrates sisterhood; and what sounds like it will be a haughty diss track turns out to be a reflection on the importance of gratitude and reappraisal.
It's tempting to think of Manchester as the inflection point in Grande's career, though she shrinks from any narrative about the bombing that might place her at its center. ""It's not my trauma,"" she says as tears fill her eyes. ""It's those families'. It's their losses, and so it's hard to just let it all out without thinking about them reading this and reopening the memory for them."" She pauses to collect herself. ""I'm proud that we were able to raise a lot of money with the intention of giving people a feeling of love or unity, but at the end of the day, it didn't bring anyone back. Everyone was like, Wow, look at this amazing thing, and I was like, What the fuck are you guys talking about? We did the best we could, but on a totally real level we did nothing. I'm sorry. I have a lot to say that could probably help people that I do want to share, but I have a lot that I still need to process myself and will probably never be ready to talk about. For a long time I didn't want to talk to anyone about anything, because I didn't want to think about anything. I kind of just wanted to bury myself in work and not focus on the real stuff, because I couldn't believe it was real. I loved going back into the studio with Pharrell because he just has this magical outlook on everything. He truly believes that the light is coming. And I'm like, Bruh, is it, though?""
SINCE MANCHESTER, GRANDE HAS emerged as an outspoken advocate of gun control, singing at last year's March for Our Lives, organized by the survivors of the Parkland massacre. She flew from Hong Kong to Charlottesville on the last day of her Dangerous Woman tour to perform in A Concert for Charlottesville, a response to the Unite the Right rally. She is passionately pro-LGBTQ and passionately anti-Donald Trump at a time when many of her peers have chosen to remain silent about politics lest they alienate a segment of their fan base. ""I would rather sell fewer records and be outspoken about what I think is some fuckery than sell more records and be . . . Switzerland. Am I allowed to say that? I love Switzerland. The fake wokes are waiting to attack!""
The studio remains Grande's safe haven. When Miller died, her friends-- Tommy, the singer Victoria Monet, her childhood best friend, Aaron Gross, and others--gathered around her in New York, where she had been living. Somebody pointed out that Jungle City Studios was right around the corner from her apartment. ""My friends know how much solace music brings me, so I think it was an all-around, let's-get-her-there type situation,"" she recalls. ""But if I'm completely honest, I don't remember those months of my life because I was (a) so drunk and (b) so sad. I don't really remember how it started or how it finished, or how all of a sudden there were 10 songs on the board. I think that this is the first album and also the first year of my life where I'm realizing that I can no longer put off spending time with myself, just as me. I've been boo'd up my entire adult life. I've always had someone to say goodnight to. So Thank U, Next was this moment of self-realization. It was this scary moment of 'Wow, you have to face all this stuff now. No more distractions. You have to heal all this shit.' ""
TOMMY BROWN BELIEVES THAT Thank U, Next is Grande's inner life set to a trap beat. ""We were in that studio to throw paint around,"" he recalls. ""We weren't thinking about an album. We were drinking a lot of champagne and, I think, doing a lot of therapy with each other. That album is so real because Ari makes her music in the real time of what's happening in her life."" When I ask Grande whether it is fair to call Thank U, Next a response to Miller's death, the tears return, along with the reciprocal apologies. Her characteristic heavy eyeliner, flared upward at the edges in the Maria Callas style, never runs. ""It's just hard to hear it so plainly put,"" she says. She has rarely commented on her relationship with Miller and has taken umbrage when the media has sought to define her according to her romantic relationships. But in May 2018, she made an exception in the form of a widely admired clapback after a fan of Miller's took to Twitter following the rapper's arrest for drunk driving, suggesting that being spurned by Grande was the cause. Her reply was swift and lacerating: ""shaming and blaming a woman for a man's inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let's please stop doing that.""
""People don't see any of the real stuff that happens, so they are loud about what they think happened,"" she says now. ""They didn't see the years of work and fighting and trying, or the love and exhaustion. That tweet came from a place of complete defeat, and you have no idea how many times I warned him that that would happen and fought that fight, for how many years of our friendship, of our relationship. You have no idea so you're not allowed to pull that card, because you don't fucking know. That's where that came from."" Grande spent years consumed by worry about Miller. Friends with her during the Dangerous Woman tour recall a woman up at all hours, desperately tracking his whereabouts to ensure he wasn't on a bender. ""It's pretty all-consuming,"" she says of her grief over Miller. ""By no means was what we had perfect, but, like, fuck. He was the best person ever, and he didn't deserve the demons he had. I was the glue for such a long time, and I found myself becoming . . . less and less sticky. The pieces just started to float away.""
Grande has since backed off from using social media to unload her feelings, instead mainly posting benignly glamorous images of ponytails and photos of her dogs (she has seven, as well as a miniature potbelly pig called Piggy Smalls). This is an about-face for a woman who has become actual friends with her fans through Twitter, who has been known to direct-message them bars of music before she has shared them with the folks at her label. ""Everyone thinks I'm crazy for doing it, but I care about what they have to say more than I care about what anyone at my label has to say, no offense,"" she explains. ""This is a me-and-them thing. I'm not taking one of those corny breaks from social media where you're like, 'The internet hurts me, I'm leaving, goodbye.' But I've definitely established a new boundary. I don't want to get myself into some shit."" Joan says that she and her daughter have talked a lot about the maintenance of boundaries lately. Ariana has always been an empath. ""She has a way of taking on everyone's pain,"" Joan says. ""She functions really beautifully, but when she has to laser herself to those heartbreaking moments, I don't think she can find anything but tears. Sure, I worry about her, but I always tell her, how you're feeling right now is perfect.""
One of the more puzzling chapters of Grande's public life was her short-lived engagement to Davidson last year, a kamikaze move made in the haze of her breakup with Miller. Her friends had convinced her to decamp to New York, to escape L.A. and her patterns there. ""My friends were like, 'Come! We're gonna have a fun summer.' And then I met Pete, and it was an amazing distraction. It was frivolous and fun and insane and highly unrealistic, and I loved him, and I didn't know him. I'm like an infant when it comes to real life and this old soul, been-around-the-block-a-million-times artist. I still don't trust myself with the life stuff.""
Art is made richer through experience, of course, and Grande has never made better art--or sold more records--than when she decided to make music out of the bitter history of the last two years. But it's nice to get away from oneself now and then: She is currently writing and producing the soundtrack to the upcoming film reboot of Charlie's Angels, will costar in Ryan Murphy's Netflix adaptation of the Broadway musical The Prom--and there's a big acting job she's hoping to land, though she doesn't want to jinx it.
""I have this idea of what I'd like to be,"" she says. ""I can see this stronger, amazing, fearless version of myself that one day I hope to evolve into. Sometimes I try to be that for my fans before I actually am that myself. I think I've been avoiding putting in the work. You know how that gets: You push your therapist away at some point, but then you have to get back to it."" She musters a laugh. ""Do you know a good therapist?""Embed"

So I got pregnant so we can pregnant at the same time

Ariana Grande told me my hair looks sexy pushed back
She's not wrong

Ariana broke off an engagement
So I found a guy to propose to me
And I broke off an engagement

I heard she's a lesbian now
And dating some chick called Aubrey
It's fucking sick

I heard if you recorded her snoring
And play it backwards it sounds like fantasia

Ariana said, ""honest to God knock me out""
So I decided to punch myself in the face
It was awesome
I mean, he was really cute you know?
He was really cute
And it was, it was really big

Well, I've only gone out with one guy
That had a big front tooth
And I liked it 'cause he never got anything stuck in the front teeth

No

788,Ariana Grande,Open Letter Critiquing Sexism,,,,"HAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....
what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.
I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled ""After Black Power, Women's Liberation"".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex (or any sex for that matter).... she's a ""slut"".
If a man has sex..... HE'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used ""bitches""/""hoes""... how lovely) he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. ""AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!"".
I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with (or not) / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.
I want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.
One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.
""any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood."" - Gloria Steinem1Embed"

Well, it picked up your little turtle now
And made it fitting dead(?)

That bird just dropped him on a roof

Turtles are reptiles, that's a fact
So go tell your dad
Or maybe your mom
To fetch a ladder
Or borrow one from Tom
Assuming you know
A dude named Tom
Although it would be kind of weird if you
Don't know a single Tom!

And give him a nice kiss on his shell
Give a little smooch to your green fella

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time

Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. You're right
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through

You wear your heart right on your sleeve, but
You have got to fix that
Or your friends will up and leave
There's no way you don't see it
I know your house ain't dark
And don't you kid yourself it's
It's not a beauty mark
Beauty marks are little and cute
Like Cat
It's really really gross when we're at the table
And I have to look at that ugly brown zit
Every bite of my tuna sandwich
Makes me feel like I'm tasting it
So do yourself and your pals a favor
Have your doc fire up this laser
And aim it at that nasty beaut
Or all your friends will continue to puke
That means throw upEmbed"

Put that paper in the picture, like a diorama
Gotta face a lot people that are opposite
'Cause the world told me we ain't got that common sense
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you will never know a God, without a Goddess
As honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other when we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

Rolex nah deh pon uno dutty gyal time?
Yo, I told 'em pull up on me faster than Danica
That's on the low I'm tryna blow him like harmonicas

He want a mix between Hillary and Monica

Rip the beat, then I, I stitch it up

If you knew better, you would do better

Muitos momentos deixados de lado
Nao compre promessas, me faca te amar
Tudo o que eu caro e seu master card

Se tem eu quero, nao tem, me esquece
Me compre sapatos de sola vermelha
Do meu coracao, Lobotan e a senha
Se tem limite, nem olhe pra mim
Pode passar no meu debito sim
Com muito dinheiro me sinto amada

Baby meko ab nai karna pretend
You don't know what is crying
Don't pretend this is a lie
You don't know what is crying
Don't pretend this is a lie
Baby meko tujhese ab chaye freedom
Bohat dekha tera nakda karta the end
Tere liye maine dekha tha wo dream ghar
Pink car, beach par tu hoti meri dream girl
Sunset ka feeling hum dono lete
Lika a movie on screen girl
Par
Mein dekha tu karti nahi mujhe se pyaar
You only love my bills girl
Baby meko ab nai karna pretend
Baby meko chaye ab isse the end
Baby meko ab nai karna pretend
Dekha nai tha maine tujh jaisa gold digger
Lagta maine hi chada liya khud sar par
Mujhe chor meri maa
Mujhe maaf kar
Sorry meri jaan ab tu please aage badh

Baby meko ab nai karna pretend
Mein gucci, louis, prada laya
Jab tune chaha tab
Nai karna pretend mujhe
Nai rehna kisi dhoke mein
Jabse mein aaya tere sath har din roota mein
Tera netflix, outfits, cosmetics
Ka payment sara kiya mein
Phir bhi tu jaisa chahti
Waisa har ek din jiya mein
Mujhe maaf kar
Mujhe maaf kar
Mein tera na koi naukar
Baby meko ab nai karna nai karna nai karna nai karna
Pretend nai karna nai karna nai karna nai karna
Baby meko ab nai karna pretend

856,Ariana Grande,Woman Like Me / God is a Woman,Spectra,2019,2019-07-24,"I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewelry dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, ""Girl, you're trouble"" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy, and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still, I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me (a woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me
And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yonce with a little bit of
""Love Drunk"" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, ""Girl, you're trouble"" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy, and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still, I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me (a woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)

857,Ariana Grande,CITADEL,,2021,2021-12-12,"Are you happy? Do your dreams still sink in down?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find your way to come back around
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you handle my shoes (hand over shoes)
Let's put them topics to bed and go
Fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss them all, no offence, yeah
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
I'm better off without him (yeah,yeah,yeah)
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya
My love is fallin' down
Playin' the victim when all my envisionings
Come slowly tumbling down
Putting me back on the ground
I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?

I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
'Cause every time you leave, you find your way to come back around

858,Ariana Grande,I am Better off without you,I am Better off without you - Single,2020,2020-08-08,"Found out you've been cheating on me
So I'm gonna just let you be
Because I don't wanna start war
I know your watching me up there, lord

I remember driving to your house
You always used to treat me like a mouse
I always loved when you made your cream
If you know what I mean

The day I met you
I always thought you would never leave me
But tonight was the night
I've been depressed over 4 days
And now I realize...
I'm better off without you
(Better off without you)

I've already moved on
I'm used to making the breakfast I would make you which were buns
I ain't gonna cry about your shit (Go girl,)
You were such a bitch
When i'm a star don't even say ""Please take me back""
I remember driving to your house
You always used to treat me like a mouse
I always loved when you made your cream
If you know what I mean

The day I met you
I always thought you never leave me
But tonight was the night
I've been depressed over 4 days
And now I realize
I'm better off without you
(Better off without you)

Now you're apologizing since I'm famous now
Boy don't start, boy don't start
You made my heart shatter
In pieces, In pieces
It's so obvious you want me for money
Boy I ain't falling for that shit again
You made me realize how strong I am as a woman
Doesn't mean you get any reward

Yeah~!
(Doesn't mean you get any reward)
Doesn't mean anything
I remember (Ooh yeah~'!)
Ain't Oliva Rodirgo
Who's gonna cry over your shit
I'm a woman

860,Ariana Grande,"Every Creature Great and Small (from the ""Kids who Care"" soundtrack)",,2006,2006-01-01,"The power's all in me
Nobody has control
Of my own destiny
I can have the world
In the palm of my own hand
There are no boundaries
Just simple things I understand

'Cause I am only here passing through
Underneath the sky, midnight blue
I could've been a butterfly
A grain of sand
A flower on the wall
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
For we are just the children of children
Of every creature great and small

Now we're looking for happiness
I thought that I could find
But love is the only thing
That ever got me by
And it lights my way
And I discover who I am
What matters most to me
Is that I give back all I can

'Cause I am only here passing through
Underneath the sky, midnight blue
I could've been a ladybug, a ray of light
A tree that's standing tall
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
For we are just the children of children
Of every creature great and small

This precious moment in time
I can't really say that it's mine
I'm just a visitor
Walking through this grand design

Look up at the heavens above
Surely they were made out of love
I believe in something like a miracle
The sun comes up at all
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
And reach out to the children of children
Of every creature great and small
I am only here passing through
Underneath the sky, midnight blue
I could've been a hummingbird, a mountain stream
Or anything at all
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around her
For we are just the children of children
Of every creature great and smallEmbed"
